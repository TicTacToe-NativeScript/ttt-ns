# Tic Tac Toe
With this application the users can create [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) games. A user creates a game and waits for another to join. When the game is over score is tallied and saved for users to look back to (SQLite). Highscore can be previewed with top 10 players sorted by win/loss/games played ratio. Games can be either public or private (protected by passcode).

## Functionality:
* Play Tic Tac Toe games with other players around the world
* Save score locally to SQLite, and in the cloud using Telerik Backend Services
* Register / Login users (fire and forget)
* Provide user statistics and highscore
